While direct comparison via the same metric is not possible, general comparison between accuracy metrics specific to each model is possible. 
The trained classification model is highly accurate - achieving accuracy scores of at least 99.7%. 

Meanwhile, the clustering model is not very accurate, achieving a silhouette score of 0.17. This score did not improve significantly with 5-fold cv, different initial centroids, or different numbers of clusters. 

Given that the VGG16 model was trained on a large number of complex images, with a large number of classes, the feature extraction and hence clustering method used here
might be better suited for more complex image clustering tasks. Also, it can easily be used on other tasks, as long as a suitable 
feature extraction method is specified. Indeed, using a simpler feature extraction method, we were able to obtain a much better silhouette score with just 1/3rd of the images. 

Separately, the classification model here would be suitable for deployment on recognising the 5 specific rice varieties we have trained it on.
